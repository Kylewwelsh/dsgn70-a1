## Site Breakdown
1. **Design**
- Horizontal nav bar used to navigate through site.
- Homepage uses cards to promote its key points of interest and information. Cards are able to adjust to changing device widths on mobile or desktop.
- Homepage is divided into sections, with each section using the rule of 3's from the visual hierarchy; Rows of 3 for the main cards. 3 options of beers in the gallery. and 3 info cards at the bottom.
- Images used support the older taproom with modern art and design.
- Colors help build brand recognition for new customers.
- Sticky/fixed header is used to keep the menu within the users view as they scroll the page, as well as keep the main logo and brand identifier present as users scroll the site.
- Social media links with icons as well as the phone number are also on the fixed header, there is also a contact page using a form for an alternate way to contact the brewery. 
- Radio buttons on the contact form are barley visible due to the background of the [contact us](https://wildrosetaproom.com/barracks-events-catering/#food) page.
- Main cards are changed and updated to reflect the current changing landscape as well as relay proper information needed to their customers.
- Main cards used to promote products the business feels are needed.
- Gallery is able to promote its top beers as well as any seasonal or special releases.
- Other pages of the site don't alter from the main color scheme, but incorporate the strong colors associated with their different products into the [beers page.](https://wildrosetaproom.com/beer/) 
- Wild Rose uses a second site with age verification for their store. This is run through Shopify, the color scheme follows the main site and a clickable menu option to go back to the main site is on the nav bar.
- The sticky header is no longer used on the Shopify hosted site, users lose site of the menu and most importantly the logo when scrolling.
- Cards on the desktop Shopify site shrink instead of stack, and the overall site is responsive.
- Shopify site offers a search option that the main site does not.
2. **Accessibility & Usability**
- Not all links that open new tabs are labeled for use by assistive technology.
- Menu options not labeled for use by assistive technology.
- Meta viewport display not set up to properly support visually impaired customers.
- Good text spacing for usability and readability.
3. **Mobile Friendliness**
- Website is highly responsive on mobile device, cards stack on top of each other.
- Gallery goes from 3 items to 1, functionality still responsive to flip through the gallery images.
- Location and gallery information becomes stacked and condensed for easy viewing on mobile devices.
- Mobile menu switches from horizontal nav bar to a hamburger menu.
- Hamburger menu switches locations between androids and iOS users.
- Shopify hosted store uses the hamburger menu as well, and the cards become stacked staying a good viewable size for the user. 
- Shopify mobile site also offers a search option that the main site does not.
## Conclusion
The Wild Rose Brewery uses a modern design with vintage color styles to pay tribute to their tap room. With good ability to scan and responsiveness it gives viewers with no accessibility needs a good experience. Website accessibility could be improved, but the overall product helps more than it hinders its business. Labeling buttons, forms and photos will help screen readers and improve the accessibility for impaired users. The Shopify hosted store Wild Rose has does a good job of staying consistent with the main sites deign, the only issue is that when you click on the store from the main site it doesn't open a new tab for users. If a user is about to be taken away from a main site, a new tab should always be used to keep them close your main site.
