## Site Breakdown
1. **Design**
- Horizontal nav bar used to navigate through site.
- Homepage uses cards to promote its key points of interest and information. Cards are able to adjust to changing device widths on mobile or desktop.
- Homepage is divided into sections, with each section using the rule of 3's from the visual hierarchy; Rows of 3 for the main cards. 3 options of beers in the gallery. and 3 info cards at the bottom.
- Sticky/fixed header is used to keep the menu within the users view as they scroll the page.
2. **Accessibility & Usability**
- Not all links that open new tabs are labeled for use by assistive technology.
- Menu options not labeled for use by assistive technology.
- Meta viewport display not set up to properly support visually impaired customers.
- Good text spacing for usability and readability.
3. **Mobile Friendliness**
- Website is highly responsive on mobile device, cards stack on top of each other.
- Gallery goes from 3 items to 1, functionality still responsive to flip through the gallery images.
- Location and gallery information becomes stacked and condensed for easy viewing on mobile devices.
## Conclusion
The Wild Rose Brewery uses a modern design with vintage color styles to pay tribute to their tap room. With good scanability and responsiveness it gives viewers with no accessibility needs a good experience. Website accessibility could be improved, but the overall product helps more than it hinders its business.
